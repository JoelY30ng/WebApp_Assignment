                <li>Pricing Explanation
                <p>Due to it being more suited to students rather than professionals or for performances, the rental price for the Bundy BTR-300 could be rented for just RM120 a month, saving cost for the aspiring trumpet student. The base price of the BTR-300 is RM2145, meaning the student could rent it for a whole year and still be saving money compared to going out and buying it on his or her own.</p></li>
                <li>Disclaimer
                <p>When in possession of the instrument, the user holds full responsibility for what happens to the instrument. If the instrument rented is in anyway damaged, the customer will have to replace said instrument for the rental service. Late returners of the instrument would be issued a warning in a week, and will be subjegated to a RM150 late fee. For every subsequent week, another RM150 would be added.</p></li>
