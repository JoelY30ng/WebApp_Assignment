              <li>Pricing Explanation
              <p>Due to it being more suited to students rather than professionals or for performances, the rental price for the Bundy BTR-300 could be rented for just RM120 a month, saving cost for the aspiring trumpet student. The base price of the BTR-300 is RM2145, meaning the student could rent it for a whole year and still be saving money compared to going out and buying it on his or her own.</p></li>
