    <h1>Brass Family</h1>
    <p>The brass family is a family of musical instruments which is easily distinguisable by recognising it's usually shiny metallic surface and distinctive shape. All brass instruments have roughly the same shape, starting from a mouthpiece, through a
      tube and finally out of the bell shaped mouth. Examples of brass instruments are the horn, trombone and prehaps most famous, the trumpet.To learn more click <a href="https://www.orsymphony.org/learning-community/instruments/brass/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</p>
