        <h1>Woodwind Family</h1>
        <p>Instruments of the woodwid family are split into two groups, the ones with reeds, like the clarinets, and the flutes, which are instruments without reeds, and are played through a mouthpiece, like piccolos. The instruments in this family all used to be made of wood, hence their name, but today, they are made of usually metal. They are played by blowing air through the mouthpiece and opening or closing the holes with your fingers to change the pitch.
